Heyo, Variant here.

I've always kinda wanted to live that hip blogger life and figured with the power of GitHub Pages and [jekyll][jekyll-gh], it was finally time. It's a little empty right now, but make yourselves at home :).

My goal is to keep people updated on the status of the Medabots Game Boy and Game Boy Color translation projects [we're working on][medabots-gh], as well as what we might be stuck on... 

We might also have some posts regarding Medabots news in general if I can convince some people to contribute here, so keep your fingers crossed for that.

As for a status update, here's what we've got...

# Medabots 1 (Game Boy)
* The patch is out there and playable (get the latest patch [here][medarot1-latest])
* The portraits version is still in-progress, I'd love to find someone who's played the WonderSwan version and could help map the portraits accordingly
* [Someone][hideto-twitter] has been working on the Spanish translation of the patch, I'm pretty sure it's close to completion if not completed already
	* He's also been working on doing portrait mapping and trying to add the Medabots lines that don't exist at all in the GB version (though, without sprites)

## Parts Collector 1/2
* Text is dumped, and it's pretty much identical to Medarot 1 code-wise
* We need a translator
	* I think there's only a few hundred lines total, and most are duped between the two games

# Medabots 3
* Text is dumped (about 7500ish unique lines)
* We need translators (and probably someone to drive localization)
	* If you leave localization to me, we'll see a lot of [this][holy-medaroli]
	* We have some translators who drop-in from time to time, but no huge driven effort to get everything translated :(
* Disassembly/hacking work is in-progress to translate tilemaps
	* Though, we kinda need translators for some things

# Site / Blog
* Right now the site is [empty][medabots-site]
	* Ideally I'd like to use it to link to relevant wikis and project pages at some point
* I'm not particularly gifted at making things look pretty, maybe someone wants to volunteer to spruce up the main page and blog?

That's all I've got for now. Maybe we'll have found a translator by the next time I post.
